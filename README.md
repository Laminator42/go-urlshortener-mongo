# URL Shortener

For learning purposes I tried to build a URL Shortener. It is very close to Alan Bardales' solution [here](https://alan-g-bardales.medium.com/simple-url-shortener-with-go-gin-and-mongodb-87f5e13dbbae). It will deviate in the future since I want to extend on his solution.

## Next steps

- [ ] Add Swagger UI
- [ ] Build simple frontend on top (maybe Vue3?)
- [ ] Dockerize application
- [ ] Build a browser extension that resolves short links bevor you click on it
